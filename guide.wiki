= Build your own Arch Repository for Pacman =

We will create a new package repo for Pacman package manager which will work
without any AUR helper. I am not gonna sign my packages because I don't know
how to.



== Creating the database for the repository ==

1. Add all the compressed packages to appropriate architecture folders. For
   example, in a `x86_64` folder, add all the `x86_64` packages.
2. Then generate a database file using the command:
    {{{sh
    repo-add akki-arch-repo.db.tar.gz *.pkg.tar.zst
    }}}
   Here, the `akki-arch-repo` is the name of the repo which will be identified
   by Pacman.
3. It will create 4 files:
    1. `akki-arch-repo.db.tar.gz`: The database file.
    2. `akki-arch-repo.files.tar.gz`: The files of the repo
    3. `akki-arch-repo.db`: Symlink to the database file.
    4. `akki-arch-repo.files`: Symlink to the files of the repo
4. These symlinks will not go on a git repository.
5. So just delete the symlinks and rename the files to that of the symlinks
6. Then just commit and push the new files to the git repository.

== Adding the Repo to Pacman ==

1. You will have to edit the file `/etc/pacman.conf` and add the following
   lines:
    {{{
    [akki-arch-repo]
    SigLevel = Optional DatabaseOptional
    Server = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akshettrj/$repo/main/$arch
    }}}
2. The Server link should be a *raw* link from whichever Git host you are using
3. For GitLab, it will be: `https://gitlab.com/akshettrj/$repo/-/raw/main/$arch`
